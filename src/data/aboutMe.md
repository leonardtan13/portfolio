My name is Leonard Tan 😊

I aspire to use technology to improve the lives of people around the world.

### Education
Currently, I am in my final year at Singapore Management University, reading a double degree in Business Management and Information Systems.

My major is in Software Development, but I also dabble with analytics in some of my pet projects.

### Technology expertise
I have built multiple projects using Java, Python, Javascript, and have used frameworks including Spring Boot, Django and React.

I am also a Google certified [Associate Cloud Engineer](https://www.credential.net/76ebab04-f236-4502-a38e-039af2a87c83) and an AWS certified [Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/7a9e940f-bace-45bf-bda1-7d085a850dcb?source=linked_in_profile).


### Hobbies
In my free time, I like to run 🏃‍♂️, lift at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, bake 🍞🥐, and cook for my family 🍝🍤.
